# Grid

This repsonsive grid was created to in order to give equal divisions across the content area throughout the site. We have created a 6, 5, and 4 column grid. This provides a variety of different options for layout and design as long as the amount of columns equals to the span of the grid.  The margin is equal to 30px for each column.  For mobile phones the columns will stack vertically.
{% highlight html %}
    <div class="col span_1_of_6">
        1 of 6
    </div>
{% endhighlight %}
